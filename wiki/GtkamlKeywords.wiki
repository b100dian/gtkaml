#summary gtkaml-specific keywords

= Introduction =

As seen in the [Example example] or in the tests and sample that come with gtkaml, there is a *prefix* (usually referred to as `xmlns:g="http://gtkaml.org/0.2"` or `xmlns:gtkaml="http://gtkaml.org/0.2"`) that contains some attributes that are _not_ part of the Gtk+ Vala bindings.

Here are their specifications, assuming the prefix is declared with *`xmlns:g`*.

=== g:name ===
The name of the class you're creating. May contain fully qualified name.

Allowed only at the root tag level.

=== g:namespace ===

=== g:private ===

=== g:existing ===
Specifies that the current widget doesn't get constructed, but it configures a an existing widget.

The value is the identifier/expression under which the existing widget is reachable.

The expression is cast to the tag's name (e.g. `<VBox g:existing="dialog.vbox1" spacing="1" />` becomes `(dialog.vbox as VBox).spacing = 1`)

Specifies that the current widget doesn't get added to the parent container.

The only valid value is "true".

The code may use `target` as the name of the current widget, just like with a signal
