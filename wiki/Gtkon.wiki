#summary Gtkaml Object Notation

== Introduction ==

Gtkon is a JSON-like syntax alternative to the standard XML that Gtkaml provides.

== Gtkon Syntax ==

Just like the XML syntax, each node corresponds to a widget which is added to the parent container.

Although colon-separated prefixes are still present as aliases to imported namespaces, the more lax syntax allows for the following shortcuts:

  * nodes just end on closing brace, no need to repeat the opening node name
  * values without whitespace may be left unquoted
  * attributes may not have a value, in which case they are treated as ="true". A leading "!" means "false"
  * public members may be introduced directly with a leading `$` on the attribute (`$id` instead of `gtkaml:public="id"`). Private members start with `$.`. Referencing an existing member is done with `&`
  * code islands are between  -{ and }-
 

=== Example ===

{{{
Dialog gtkon:version=0.2 using=Gtk gtkaml:name="SearchDialog" title="Find" !has-separator destroy={Gtk.main_quit} {
	/*Dialog already has a VBox named vbox (existing) and is already added to the Dialog (standalone) */
	VBox spacing=10 &vbox gtkaml:standalone {
		HBox !homogeneous spacing=20 !expand {
			Label with-mnemonic label="_Search for:" mnemonic-widget={search_entry} !expand;
			Entry $search_entry;
		}
		CheckButton $match_case with-mnemonic label="_Match case" !expand;
		CheckButton $find_backwards with-mnemonic label="Find _backwards" !expand;
	}
}
