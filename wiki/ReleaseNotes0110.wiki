#summary Some bugs that blocked entire goals from 0.1

  * fixed "issue #1" which prevented a widget from a namespace to be added into a container from another namespace (and viceversa) e.g. this works now:
{{{
<MyNS:MyBox>
  <Gtk:Label label="test"/>
</MyNS:MyBox>
}}}
  * added the `Gtk.MenuItem`'s constructor in implicits.ini because it required a parameter that was not a property
  * fixed an issue when looking up for constructor parameters' type (i.e do not use the widget's property type, but use the constructor's formal parameter type). The `MenuItem` didn't work because of this.
  * fixed "issue #3" with gtkaml:name and gtkaml:namespace which were attributed as properties of `this`
  * packaging: removed the signal handler from example0.gtkaml that caused a vala crash
