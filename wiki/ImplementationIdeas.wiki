== Construction ==

Gtk widgets, and other objects too, may not have a no-parameters constructor.
In this case, we need to store the name of a property that needs to be feed as constructor parameter (and give it a "required" state), or have a good default 
(e.g. `gtk_label_new(NULL)` is a good default, but others may not be)
