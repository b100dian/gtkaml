#summary gtkaml 0.1.0.0 release notes
This is the first `gtkaml` release
  * it requires glib-2.0, vala-1.0 >= 0.1.6, libxml-2.0, and gtk+-2.0
  * has all the capabilities described in [DesignGoals] marked as 'DONE in 0.1'

Known issues:
  * the error reporting needs improvement
  * `Container.add ()` is not used/found because it's a signal. Instead, `Container.add_with_properties ()` it's used for now. Future releases will lookup for signals too when determining the add method to use
  * if you have Vala installed in an /unusual/place you need to specify `--vapidir=/unusual/place/share/vala/vapi` at command-line parameter
  * although the ./configure script specifies vala-1.0 >= 0.1.5 you actually have to have vala 0.1.6 installed (i can't guarantee forward compatibility with later versions, though)
